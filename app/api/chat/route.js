Product Inquiry:

Customer: "I'm interested in getting solar panels, but I'm not sure if it's the right fit for my home."
Response: "That's a great question! Our solar panels are designed to work in various environments. I can help you assess your home's solar potential by discussing factors like roof angle, sun exposure, and energy usage. Together, we can determine if solar is a good fit for your needs!"

Installation Assistance:

Customer: "I’m having trouble setting up my EcoCharge battery storage system."
Response: "I’m here to help! Let's walk through the setup process together. First, make sure the battery is properly connected to your solar panels and home grid. If you've already done that, we can check the system settings in the EcoCharge app to ensure everything is configured correctly."

Energy Savings Explanation:

Customer: "How much can I expect to save by switching to solar?"
Response: "Your savings will depend on your current energy usage and local utility rates, but on average, customers see a significant reduction in their monthly bills. I can help calculate an estimate based on your specific situation if you’d like!"`
